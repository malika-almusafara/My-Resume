                <h1>Resume of Shanice Bennett</h1>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p> I am a self-driven, ambitious and thorough person in every part of my life. <br />
                        I am currently completing my Doctorates Degree in Functional Medicine and this increased <br />
                        my motive to succeed in everything I do. None of my duties in life interfere with the other <br /> 
                        because I never go after anything without a thorough plan, and several back up plans. <br /> 
                        I learn from every failure and criticism, and most of all I quickly adjust and improve. <br />
                        My willingness to succeed is comparable to some of the best out there, with the goal of <br /> 
                        maintaining peace, hard work, and stability in my life. 
                    </p>
